Owebhacking
============

Scripts for the O2 framework based around web automation

There is a cheatsheet because I keep forgetting the useful commands
Its basically C#. I don't yet use it to its full potential, I currently only useit for webscripting quick demos for clients.
As I use it more, I will increase the examples and the cheatsheet
I will eventually make the cheatsheet into a markdown sheet, but no time right now
